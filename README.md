# PI Controller for DC Motor
Assembly language code that functions as a cruise control system for a small DC motor. Included in this file is code used for a keypad, LCD display, and closed loop functionality.

Using this code, a user can manually change motor parameters, such as the desired motor velocity, in order to produce a desired motor response. Basic commands, such as backspace 
control, needed to be manually coded in such that the user could remove characters on the display.
